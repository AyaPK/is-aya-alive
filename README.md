# Is Aya Alive???

**Spoiler Alert**: She totally is! ðŸ’–

Ever wondered about Aya's current state of existence? Wonder no more! This app tracks her heartbeat, activity, and proves once and for all that she is, indeed, alive and kicking. 

## What's This Magic? 

This isn't just an app. It's a real-time Aya-existence-verification system powered by her Oura Ring. Whether she's resting, active, or working out, you'll know EXACTLY what she's up to.

## Environment Setup

### Environment Variables

This project uses a `.env` file to manage sensitive configuration details. 

#### Required Environment Variables
- `OURA_TOKEN`: Your Oura Ring API token

#### Setup Instructions
1. Create a `.env` file in the project root
2. Add your Oura Ring API token:
   ```
   OURA_TOKEN=your_oura_api_token_here
   ```

#### Security Notes
- The `.env` file is already included in `.gitignore`
- Never commit your actual API token to version control
- For Netlify deployments, set the `OURA_TOKEN` in the Netlify environment variables

### Running the App
1. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
2. Create `.env` file with your token
3. Run the application:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```
Simply open `index.html` in your browser or use a local development server.

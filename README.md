# Oura Ring Status App

## Local Development

### CORS Considerations
For local development, you'll need to handle CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) carefully. The Oura Ring API will require proper authentication and CORS configuration.

Recommended local development setup:
1. Use a local development server (e.g., `python -m http.server` or `live-server`)
2. Configure your backend proxy or use browser extensions to manage CORS during development

### Running the App
Simply open `index.html` in your browser or use a local development server.
